//! Tall grass and flowers: little plants on the grass.
//!
//! A plant isn't a block: it's two crossed pictures standing in an air cell
//! on top of grass. You walk through it; one click breaks it (tall grass
//! sometimes gives seeds); a block placed there, or digging the grass
//! under it, gets rid of it. They're all drawn as one mesh, built again
//! when one changes.
